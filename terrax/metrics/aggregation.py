class Aggregator:
  """Defines aggregation process over dimensions of statistics.

  This class configures the process of computing an `AggregationState` from raw
  statistics. It specifies which dimensions to reduce over, and what weighting,
  scaling or binning to apply before the reduction. Weighting, scaling and
  binning can be inferred either from the coordinates of the processed
  statistics or from the `context` values on the Aggregator, that holds
  coordinate values used to aggregate statistics over dimensions one slice at a
  time.

  A common use case for the `context` is performing aggregation over data slices
  (e.g. 'timedelta') one at a time. `context` plays a role of passing the
  coordinate values to the weighting, scaling and binning functions, since those
  are not available for individual slices.

  Attributes:
    dims_to_reduce: Sequence of coordinates or dimension names to reduce over.
    weight_by: Sequence of `weighting.Weighting` instances to apply.
    scale_by: Optional sequence of `scaling.Scaler` instances to apply.
    bin_by: Optional sequence of `binning.Binning` instances to apply.
    skip_missing: If True, `dims_to_reduce` that are not present in a given
      field will be skipped. If False, a `ValueError` is raised.
    skipna: If True, NaNs will be omitted in the aggregation.
    keep_weights_for_nans: If True, weights corresponding to NaN values are
      retained. Such behavior might be desired when computing the loss, where a
      NaN value is slipped without increasing the relative weight of the other
      entries in the statistics. Has effective only when `skipna` is True.
    context: Optional dictionary of context fields, used for coordinate
      dependent weighting, binning and scaling. Keys must include all dimensions
      expected by the weighting, binning and scaling instances that are not
      included on the statistis `Field`s themselves.
