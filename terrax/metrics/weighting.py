  If a matching coordinate is found on the `field`, it returns `masked_value`

  If no matching coordinate is found of the `field`, the `context` is serched

  `field` slices. If found, it returns a weight of `masked_value` if the value
  from the context (context[dim_name]) is present in `mask_coord`, and
  `unmasked_value` otherwise.

  If coordinates for multiple dimensions are found, the resulting weights are
  multiplied.

  If `skip_missing` is True, dimensions from `mask_coord` not found in the
